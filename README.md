## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   cd weatherforcast
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Install dependencies:
   Ensure that you have the necessary SDKs and libraries installed. You can do this by syncing the
   Gradle files in Android Studio.
4. Build the project:
   Use the following command to build the project:

 ```bash
  ./gradlew build
   ```

5. Run the app:
   Connect an Android device or start an emulator, and run the app from Android Studio.

## Configuration

**appkey.properties and appkey_default.properties**

To configure the app for accessing the weather API, you need to provide your API key.

1. Register account and generate API_KEY on https://openweathermap.org

2. Create appkey.properties:
   In the app/ directory, create a file named appkey.properties. This file should contain the
   following line:

```
WEATHER_API_KEY=[put-your-key-here-without-quote-or-bracket]
```

Replace [put-your-key-here-without-quote-or-bracket] with your actual API key for the weather API.
The project includes appkey_default.properties, which serves as a template. You can refer to this
file for the structure and required properties.

## Usage

Once the app is set up and running, you can start using it to fetch and view weather data. The appâ€™s
UI will allow you to enter a city name and fetch the corresponding weather details.
